	<h4>Restaurant To-Go Menu Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Let’s face it lots of folks like to eat their food at home! This is the mini-menu of restaurant menus, based obviously on your main menu design if you have one.
		This came about with the marvelous invention of the restaurant to-go menu, which happens to fit nicely in a kitchen drawer, next to the phone, in the glove box or on the refrigerator.
		This is a great way for your restaurant patrons to order out.
	</p>
	<p>
		These typically come in a tri-fold or a quad fold format, sometimes we do special custom die cut designs as well.
		We can provide everything from design to printing and have them shipped directly to your door.

	<h4>Restaurant Slugger Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Sluggers are a great marketing tool for restaurants. Typically a slugger accompanies a primary restaurant menu and can display your current specials or hot menu items.
		They might also display your drink or dessert menu. These are usually either inserted into your menu pages or with the menu.
		The reason we design sluggers is because they are easily changed and are cost effective versus replacing an entire menu. Sluggers come in all shapes, sizes and styles.
		We are happy to help you design any sluggers you might need for your restaurant.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Restaurant Table Tent Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		The premium marketing tool for restaurants is the table tent. There are a wide variety of tents that can be used to display specials, drinks, create social media connections and more.
		Our marketing team can help design and implement successful table tents in your restaurant.
		As usual you can find some of our recent table tent designs in our restaurant portfolio found here.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Door Hanger Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		It has probably been a long time since you have had something hung on your door knob.
		In many areas they are no longer legal, so you will want to check your local laws before we design and print a door hanger for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Door hangers can be great if you’re trying to target a certain area or demographic with your ideas or products.
		Also if you are trying to avoid postage costs, paying a poor broke teenager or college student to hang these for you is a very affordable option.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Bool Layout and Cover Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Occasionally we have an author approach us to do book design and layout. We can handle your book design and complete layout of your pages as needed.
		We will then of course talk about design and concept before we get started. We can design your book layout and cover to fit your publisher’s specifications.
		You will want to be positively sure that you are at your final draft before we start, as making corrections after we have started can be very time consuming and costly.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Envelope Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		If you conduct a lot of mailing or mailings as a part of your everyday business, then it is a good idea to brand and put the envelopes to use for you as well.
		With custom printed and colored envelops you can really stand out in the mailbox and increase your open rates or your clients responsiveness.
		Let us design and print some great envelopes for you today! We offer a wide ranges of color and layout options.
		Typically envelope design is bundled with business card and letterhead design.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Letterhead Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		So you have a great logo design done by SilverMoon Creative Design already, right? We have found that some businesses still need letterhead for various reasons, although most do not use letterhead anymore.
		Perhaps you need it for legal reasons or maybe to send out special notes to customers? We would be happy to design your letterhead for you.

	</p>
	<br />
	<h4>Presentation Folder Design</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Some instances require you to spoof up your presentation for a potential customer, or employer. Fully branded, full color/designed presentation folders are the way to go.
		This is an especially useful printed piece if you are trying to sell a particular product to retail or other types of sales outlets.
		Used in conjunction with branded business cards, letterhead and product brochures, this is definitely the way to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		SilverMoon Creative Design, Inc can design your folder, and all material to be contained within the presentation. We can also provide the printing for you as well.
		Keep in mind a full presentation folder with all materials inside is quite an investment in graphic design work and printing, which can pay off in the long run if your application is appropriate
