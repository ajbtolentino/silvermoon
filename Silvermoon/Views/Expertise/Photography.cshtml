				<h4>PREGNANCY PORTRAITS</h4>
				<p>
					Pregnancy is a time of excitement and we at SilverMoon Creative Design understand that you want to capture the anticipation of one of the most unforgettable moments of your life.
					For that reason, we specialize in maternity portraits as a way for you to show your excitement and love to your upcoming daughter or son.
				</p>
				<p>
					While maternity photography can seem intimidating to some women, the friendly, experienced staff at SilverMoon Creative Design are dedicated to capturing genuine smiles in our maternity photos and to making expectant mothers feel and look beautiful.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some maternity photography tips so you can show off your special glow of joy:
					<ol>
						<li><b>Prepare your maternity photography poses</b></li>
						Before your actual photo session, think of maternity photography ideas and a series of poses you might like to do.
						Knowing ahead of time how you will be posing will help make you feel more comfortable during your maternity portrait session.
						<li><b>Come in when your baby bump is bigger</b></li>
						The whole idea of maternity photography is about the bump! So come in around six months or after when your bump is noticeable and will stand out in your maternity photos.
						<li><b>Include other family members</b></li>
						There are never any sitting fees or additional charges, so everyone in the family should plan to be in the session, this includes dad, other children, grandparents, cousins, parents, other relatives and friends.
						<li><b>Use props</b></li>
						Think of props to use in your portrait session that will emphasize your bump but also carry meaning. These props could include flowers, baby shoes, building blocks to spell your baby's name, a special toy or blanket - the sky's the limit!

	<h4>Newborn Photography</h4>
	<hr />
	<h4>CELEBRATE YOUR STORY THROUGH PHOTOGRAPHY</h4>
	<p>
		Life is made up of millions of tiny moments, constantly fluid and ever changing. We understand how evident this is in our children, who transform and change before our eyes.
		At Little Nest Portraits, we recognize the preciousness of time, and how difficult it is to stop, pause and capture it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Being part of our SilverMoon Creative Design family gives you the opportunity to easily capture your family's spirit, creating art from the present moment.
	</p>
	<p>
		SilverMoon Creative Design is the choice for baby portraiture. We bring experienced, professional photographers into any location you choose to capture your baby's first photograph with a natural, artistic style.
		We believe that babies look the most beautiful when being held in their parents' arms or cuddled in one of their own baby blankets.
		SilverMoon Creative Design captures this beauty by using only "real things"...natural window light, professional photographers and professional grade SLR digital cameras.
	</p>
	<p>
		Newborns aren't the only subject we love to photograph... we love to capture all of the milestones of family life.
		Using a photojournalistic style approach to photography, we capture your baby learning to stand, your 5-year old riding his bike with no training wheels,
		and your teenager's last photograph before she becomes an adult.
	</p>
	<p>
		We look forward to working with you and to capturing photographs that show the "real" beauty of your family.

	<h4>Boudoir Photography</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>Seductive</p>
	<p>Romantic</p>
	<p>Visually Stimulating</p>
	<p>Naughty</p>
	<p>Glamorous</p>
	<p>Erotic</p>
	<p>Artistic</p>

	<p>
		"Boudoir" is a late 18th century French word that means a woman's bedroom or private sitting space.
		Boudoir Photography captures the soft, sensual elegance of a real woman's shapes and curves.
	</p>
	<p>
		SilverMoon Creative Design can customize a Boudoir Photography Session to meet all of your needs and desires,
		allowing you to create the images that you desire. Boudoir Photography usually includes the element of implied nudity,
		providing a teasing glimpse into a woman's inner sexuality. It is up to you, the client, to determine how much or how little clothing you are wearing for your Boudoir photo shoot.
		Some women bring along a wardrobe of lingerie, other women prefer to wear nothing at all, and many women fall somewhere in between; it all depends on your personal desires.
	</p>
	<p>
		Boudoir Photographs are usually taken in a woman's own bedroom, although they can also be taken in a luxury hotel suite.
		Our photographers are professionals and will make you feel comfortable the entire session while guaranteeing great memorable shots!
		Boudoir Photography Packages

	<p>

			<li>Boudoir Photo Sessions (these make for a very unique Bachelorette Party idea or non-traditional Girls Night Out evening)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Boudoir Photography Packages make great gifts to give to the special woman in your life - or a woman can surprise the man in her life with the photographs from a Boudoir Photo session as a gift.
		Either way, you can never go wrong with buying a Boudoir Photo Session as a gift for your loved one!

	<h4>Wedding Photography</h4>
	<hr />
	<p>
		With wedding photography, it's all about the moments.  A professional wedding photographer not only has the high end equipment and practiced talent to capture and edit photos from your wedding;
		they also understand that these moments are both natural and created.
		They know that both types must be balanced to allow you to enjoy your wedding to the fullest while still having studio quality photographs to commemorate this special day.
		Our photographers are professionals.  They are skilled at capturing the random moments that will put grins on your families' faces years later and at posing shots beautiful enough for a bridal magazine without keeping you from the celebration for too long.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our photography service includes a professional lead photographer who will be in communication with you prior to the wedding.
		They will be the ones directing, capturing, and editing all of your moments from the night.
		All of the photos they take will be edited and provided to you online and on a flash drive with full copyrights.
		Your photographer will also artistically edit a number of "album" shots to make those pictures really stand out.
		Secondary photographers are available to catch more of those random moments and smiles from the evening.
	</p>
	<p>
		SilverMoon Creative Design’s approach to Wedding Photography is unique - SilverMoon Creative Design charges by event and then in turn gives the couple a CD or flash drive of all edited images.
		We can customize your wedding package to best fit your budget, our packages include unlimited digital shots, photo books and album, on-site slide show and among other things.
		Please contact us by phone or by email and by visiting our contact page on our website for more details.
