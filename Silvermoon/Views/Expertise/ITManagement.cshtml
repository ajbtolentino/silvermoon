			<h4>Back Up and Disaster Recovery</h4>
			<hr />
			<p>
				Most businesses nowadays will be out of business without a reliable IT infrastructure.
				If the unthinkable were to happen, you want to be rest assured that you have a reliable and solid back-up and disaster recovery plan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Natural disasters, equipment failures and error-induced process interruptions are now accompanied by threats originating from malicious intent and overloads on the global infrastructure.
				These threats to infrastructure stability, together with competitive pressures and market demands, have emphasized the need for effective and thorough disaster recovery planning.
				It is inevitable that when the information flow stops, so does the business. Ironically, with these threats, many companies find themselves unprepared and have zero readiness in
				Disaster Recovery (DR) planning despite their increased dependence on IT systems.
			</p>

			<h4>A Customized Solution </h4>
			<p>
				SilverMoon Creative Design will work with you to develop a customized Disaster Recovery Plan based on your business and its unique needs.
				A number of factors can influence the scope of a disaster recovery solution. Business hours, availability needs, e-commerce strategies, data criticality,
				regulatory implications and many other issues must be considered during the assessment and recommendation process.
				Based on these foreseen needs, SilverMoon Creative Design can offer you a wide range of solutions including everything from Colocation with Managed Services,
				to Private Cloud services through to Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS). SilverMoon Creative Design also has disaster recovery specialists dedicated to helping you protect your Microsoft Dynamics AX,
				SAP or Oracle applications.

			<h4>High-Availability Environments</h4>

				SilverMoon Creative Design offers an alternative to investing in your own data center and operations facilities to create your Disaster Recovery site.
				Instead of building and staffing a data center, you can use SilverMoon Creative Design’s mission-critical facilities to lower your operating expenses,
				reduce capital expenditures and shorten the time it takes to accomplish your Disaster Recovery goals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allow SilverMoon Creative Design remove the burden of monitoring and managing your Disaster Recovery infrastructure to give you increased reliability,
				reduced risk and more time to focus on your core strategic issues.
			</p>

			<h4>Communication and Collaboration</h4>
			<hr />
			<p>
				Hosted Exchange, Skype for Business and SharePoint are more than just email, communication and collaboration tools.
				They are a platform for all your business activities, including calendars, contacts, file sharing, content management, chat, task lists, video conferencing and mobility.
				Exchange, Skype for Business and SharePoint align your people and your technology, enabling them to share information and work together better than they could with any other communications productivity solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				To get the most out of the exceptional tools, it’s important to understand how to deploy them in an optimal fashion for everyone in your company.
				Your employees will not use each tool exactly the same.
				Mobile sales or field workers have very different needs from desk-bound contact center staff or an inside sales team. Finance will use the tools in a far different manner than marketing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using our extensive experience across a number of different companies and industries, SilverMoon Creative Design can customize a plan that includes system design, deployment and training to ensure you get them most from your investment.
			</p>
			<p>

				With no maintenance to perform or upgrades to pay for, SilverMoon Creative Design's simple monthly per-user rate lowers your expenses while making them predictable and manageable.

			<h4>Security And Compliance</h4>
			<hr />
			<p>
				Keeping your environment safe, secure and in compliance.
				Businesses must keep confidential information protected. The company's proprietary data can be accessed by another managed hosting service provider or an internal user without appropriate clearance.
				It can be accessed even by a competitor.
			</p>
			<p>
				All companies must feel comfortable about their security capabilities. This will determine their degree of engagement, choose specific information to share, and what services they will contract from a managed services provider.
				Trust has always been a factor between organizations and is especially important when discussing security and compliance.
			</p>
			<p>
				When choosing a managed services provider, it is important for IT leaders to explore a service provider's security processes and procedures thoroughly and not focus just on technology.
				Check that certifications are in place and that it has a fully staffed security operations center (SOC) as part of the solution. In the case that your organization requires specialized industry compliance (i.e.: PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.),
				ensure that the provider have the necessary regulatory compliances in place.
				Every managed services provider should be able to articulate security policies and procedures in a formal security policy document that can be provided to prospects and customers.
			</p>
			<p>
				At SilverMoon Creative Design, our approach to customer's security concerns is demonstrated in our security framework. We base our work on the core principles of the CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
			</p>
			<p>
				The framework encompasses our managed services solutions. Everything we do for our partners is built and managed to strict best practices that provide a level of operational excellence achieved through rigorous ITIL process and procedure,
				best-in-class technology, tier 3 certified data centers and truly remarkable engineering talent. Our technical security controls are designed to industry consensus best practices by a team of senior security engineers with multiple security and vendor certifications.
				Security by design means that SilverMoon Creative Design builds solutions, specifically for your company and your unique needs, from the ground up with every tedious but critical detail considered for security and risk implications.
				It’s this attention to detail that has made SilverMoon Creative Design a preferred IT compliance partner for companies of all sizes, in just about every industry from coast-to-coast.
